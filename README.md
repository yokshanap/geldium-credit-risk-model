# Geldium Credit Risk Prediction

This project is part of a GenAI-powered data science task to predict which customers are most at risk of **credit delinquency**, based on financial and demographic data.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

We used supervised learning models to classify customers into delinquent or non-delinquent classes, helping Geldium identify potential credit risk.

### ✅ Key Tasks:
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Engineered relevant features
- Built and compared:
  - Logistic Regression (simple & interpretable)
  - Random Forest Classifier (high-performance)
- Evaluated models using:
  - Accuracy, F1 Score
  - ROC-AUC Curve
  - Feature Importance

---

## 🧠 Top 5 Predictive Features
- `Missed_Payments`
- `Credit_Score`
- `Debt_to_Income_Ratio`
- `Credit_Utilization`
- `Loan_Balance`

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation
- **Best Model**: Random Forest Classifier  
- **ROC-AUC Score**: ~0.91  
- Balanced performance across fairness groups
